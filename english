I want to become an economist. This profession requires a qualification. It's possible to get it at the university. It takes about 4 years to get the qualification. It gives an opportunity to work with different people. A specialist must know a lot about economy and how it's possible to manage limited resources. I've chosen this profession because it seems interesting to me. I'd like to work both in my home country and abroad. That's why I think mastering my English is important and I'd like to do it at home by learning new words and grammar rules.

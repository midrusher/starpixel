As a child I wanted to be a firefighter. When I was 11, I decided to become a programmer. My elder brother advised me to become a programmer. I expect that I'll be given some work for a month and hope that I'll do it for a day. Also, I hope I'll get much money. The advantages of this career is that you can stay at home and you needn't communicate a lot with people. There're no disadvantages in this profession.

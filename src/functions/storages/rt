people buy souveniers because they want to remember those moments spent in a travelling

when people go travelling, they want to buy something beautiful. In most situations these souveniers are useless. Also they buy expensive items because people think that they live only one time and may not return to this place.

Sometimes clothes and other things are cheaper than in their own country. Also, there are a lot of things that can be only bought in the certain country.

I want to get something useful as a souvenier. I'm not shopping when I'm far away from my home because I don't travel a lot. I prefer to buy components for my computer because I want my computer to be more powerful

Many people pay by card because it's more convinient because you shouldn't take with you a lot of cash. The main disadvantage of it is that someone can hack bank account and steal all money from it.
